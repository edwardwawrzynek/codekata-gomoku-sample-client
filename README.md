# Sample Client

This is a sample client written in Kotlin. It is a good place to start.

The code to be edited is in `src/main/kotlin/app/AI.kt`. You should edit the `makeMove` method, which is passed a board and must retun the move to make.
Additionally, you can place helpers related to board manipulation in `src/main/kotlin/app/Board.kt`.


## Running
`./gradlew run --args="https://codekata.herokuapp.com/ API_KEY GAME_ID"`
